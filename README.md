# Image-Dataset-Recorder

This mobile application allows the creation of a cloud dataset of 
images organized into predefined classes. The system allows the 
user to capture images with the smartphone camera, classify them 
according to predefined classes, and upload them to a linked 
database to create a dataset with the classified images.
