# Image-Dataset-Recorder

This is a mobile application that allows the creation of a cloud dataset of images subdivided into predefined classes. The system basically allows the capture of images with the cell phone camera, its classification according to pre-established classes, and the upload in a linked database, in order to create a dataset with the classified images.
